              <p>Let’s be real here - there are a lot of regulations around consumer protection. When buying leads for your business and agressively contacting prospects - how do you know you’re complying with not only TCPA, but other federal and state regulations? There are a lot of regulations that most lead buyers aren’t aware of, and the penalties can quickly drain even a large sized business.</p>
              <p>We encourage you to stay in the know with federal regulations as well as in the states you do business in. A great resource to follow is

              <p>Every lead that comes into the Leadrilla platform has provided consent to be contacted by us and our partners (you, the buyer). We store evidence of this so you are protected. However, it is important that you understand current regulations and abide by them at all times. If a lead requests that you stop contacting them, stop contacting them.</p>
              <p>Leadrilla has also teamed up with industry experts so we can constantly monitor the everchanging federal and state regulations regarding consumer protection. We’re a proud, active member of LeadsCouncil, which you can learn more about
                <a href="https://www.leadscouncil.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
              </p>
              <p>It is in our best interest to keep you compliant, and we’re always here to help and answer questions you may have.</p>
